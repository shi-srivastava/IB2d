% a_f: coefficient that triggers contraction (traveling square or Gaussian wave?)

% Length Tension Model Parameters (F1)
% Fmax: maximum isometric force produced at the optimum length of the muscle fibers
% LF:   length of the muscle fibers
% LFO:  length at which the muscle fibers exert their maximum tension
% SK:   constant specific for each muscle where SK > 0.28.


% Hill Model Parameters (F2)
% P0:   maximum load w/ NO contraction
% a:    
% b:    
% v:    velocity of muscle expansion/contraction
